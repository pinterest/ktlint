# Ideally, no experimental rule should be disabled. Ktlint should follow the dogfooding principle. This means that an
# experimental rule should only be added to the master branch no sooner than that this rule has been applied on the
# ktlint code base itself.
# For now, the experimental:argument-list-wrapping still needs to be disabled as it fails the build due to false
# positives. See https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/pull/1284
