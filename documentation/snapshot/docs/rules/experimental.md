    Up and until Ktlint version `0.47`, experimental were located in a separate `experimental` rule set. As of Ktlint version `0.48`, each rule set can optionally define experimental rules.

All experimental rules described below are part of the `standard` rule set of Ktlint. To enable all experimental rules (from all rule sets), set `editorconfig` property below:
```ini
[*.{kt,kts}]
ktlint_experimental=enabled
```
Also see [enable/disable specific rules](configuration-ktlint.md#disable-rules).

## Blank line before file annotation

Requires a blank line before the file annotation unless that file annotation is on the first line of the file.

=== "[:material-heart:](#) Ktlint"

    ```kotlin
    /*
     * Copyright comment
     */

    @file:Foo
    ```

=== "[:material-heart-off-outline:](#) Disallowed"

    ```kotlin
    /*
     * Copyright comment
     */
    @file:Foo
    ```

Rule id: `standard:blank-line-before-file-annotation`

Suppress or disable rule (1)
{ .annotate }

1. Suppress rule in code with annotation below:
    ```kotlin
    @Suppress("ktlint:standard:blank-line-before-file-annotation")

    ```editorconfig
    ktlint_standard_blank-line-before-file-annotation = disabled
    ```

!!! Note
    This rule is only run when `ktlint_code_style` is set to `ktlint_official` or `android_studion` or when the rule is enabled explicitly.

## Blank line before imports

Requires a blank line before the imports unless the imports starts at the first line of the file.

=== "[:material-heart:](#) Ktlint"

    ```kotlin
    package bar

    import foo
    ```

## Call expression wrapping

In case a call expression does not fit on the line, the lambda expression, and/or the value argument list after a reference expression are wrapped. 

=== "[:material-heart:](#) Ktlint"

    ```kotlin
    // Assume that the last allowed
    // character is at the X character
    // on the right                  X
    val foo1 = bar() {
        "some message"
    }
    val foo2 = bar(
        "foobarrrrrrrrrrrr"
    ) { "some message" }
    val foo3 = bar(
        "foobarrrrrrrrrrrr"
    ) {
        "some longgggggggggg message"
    }
    ```

=== "[:material-heart-off-outline:](#) Disallowed"

    ```kotlin
    // Assume that the last allowed
    // character is at the X character
    // on the right                  X
    val foo1 = bar() { "some message" }
    val foo2 = bar("foobarrrrrrrrrrrr") { "some message" }

## Expression operand wrapping

Wraps each operand in a multiline expression to a separate line.

=== "[:material-heart:](#) Ktlint"

    ```kotlin
    val foo1 = bar || baz
    val foo2 =
        bar1 ||
            bar2 ||
            baz1 ||
            (baz2 && baz3)
    val foo3 = bar + baz
    val foo4 =
        bar1 -
            bar2 -
            baz1 -
            (baz2 * baz3)
    ```

    ```kotlin
    val foo =
      multiLineOperand(
          "bar"
      ) || baz
    if (bar1 || bar2 ||
        baz1 || (baz2 && baz3)
    ) {
       // do something
    }

## Lambda return

Do not use a labeled return for the last statement in a lambda if that label refers to the lambda itself.

=== "[:material-heart:](#) Ktlint"

    ```kotlin
    val foo =
        "Foo"
            .let outer@{ foo ->
                if (foo != "Foo") {
                    return@outer "$foo is not expected input"
                }
                foo
                    .let { "$it was a" }
                    .let secondLet@{
                        if (foo != "Foo") {
                            return@secondLet "$foo is not expected input"
                        }
                        "$it success"
                    }.let { return@outer "$it (map after let)" }
                // This is unreachable code due to "return@outer" in let above.
                "$foo was a failure"
            }.let { "$it (let after also)" }
    ```

=== "[:material-heart-off-outline:](#) Disallowed"

    ```kotlin
    val foo =
        "Foo"
            .let outer@{ foo ->
                if (foo != "Foo") {
                    return@outer "$foo is not expected input"
                }
                foo
                    .let { return@let "$it was a" }
                    .let secondLet@{
                        if (foo != "Foo") {
                            return@secondLet "$foo is not expected input"
                        }
                        return@secondLet "$it success"
                    }.let { return@outer "$it (map after let)" }
                // This is unreachable code due to "return@outer" in let above.
                return@outer "$foo was a failure"
            }.let { return@let "$it (let after also)" }
    ```
