## Why should I use ktlint?

the short answer is **Simplicity**.

Spending time on configuration (and maintenance down the road) of hundred-line long style config file(s) is counter-productive. Instead of wasting your energy on something that has no business value - focus on what really matters (not debating whether to use tabs or spaces).

By using ktlint you put the importance of code clarity and community conventions over personal preferences. This makes things easier for people reading your code as well as frees you from having to document and explain what style potential contributor(s) have to follow.

ktlint is a single binary with both linter & formatter included. All you need is to drop it in (no need to get [overwhelmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) while choosing among [dozens of code style options](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/checks.html)).

##  How do I enable or disable a rule?

An individual rule can be enabled or disabled with a rule property. The name of the rule property consists of the `ktlint_` prefix followed by the rule set id followed by a `_` and the rule id. Examples:
```editorconfig
ktlint_standard_final-newline = disabled # Disables the `final-newline` rule in the `standard` rule set provided by KtLint
ktlint_standard_some-experimental-rule = enabled # Enables the (experimental) `some-experimental-rule` in the `standard` rule set provided by KtLint
ktlint_custom-rule-set_custom-rule = disabled # Disables the `custom-rule` rule in the `custom-rule-set` rule set (not provided by KtLint)
```

!!! note
    The *rule* properties are applied after applying the *rule set* properties and take precedence. So if a rule set is disabled but a specific rule of that rule set is enabled, then the rule will be executed.

##  How do I enable or disable a rule set?

All rules in a rule set can be enabled or disabled with a rule set property. The name of the rule set property consists of the `ktlint_` prefix followed by the rule set id. Examples:
```editorconfig
ktlint_standard = disabled # Disable all rules from the `standard` rule set provided by KtLint
ktlint_experimental = enabled # Enable rules marked as experimental for all rule sets that are enabled
ktlint_custom-rule-set = enabled # Enable all rules in the `custom-rule-set` rule set (not provided by KtLint)
```

!!! note
    All rules from the `standard` and custom rule sets are *enabled* by default and can optionally be disabled in the `.editorconfig`. All `experimental` rules are *disabled* by default and can optionally be enabled in the `.editorconfig`.

## Can I have my own rules on top of ktlint?

Absolutely, "no configuration" doesn't mean "no extensibility". You can add your own ruleset(s) to discover potential bugs, check for anti-patterns, etc.

See [adding a custom rule set](../api/custom-rule-set/) for more information.

## How do I suppress errors for a line/block/file?

!!! tip
    Suppressing a `ktlint` violation is meant primarily as an escape latch for the rare cases when **ktlint** is not able to produce the correct result. Please report any such instances using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/issues)).

To disable a specific rule you'll need the rule identifier which is displayed at the end of the lint error.

An error can be suppressed using:

* EOL comments
* Block comments
* @Suppress annotations

=== "[:material-heart:](#) Suppress annotation"

    ```kotlin
    // Suppressing all rules for the entire file
    @file:Suppress("ktlint")

    // Suppress a single rule for the annotated construct
    @Suppress("ktlint:standard:no-wildcard-imports")
    import foo.*

    // Suppress multiple rules for the annotated construct
    @Suppress("ktlint:standard:no-wildcard-imports", "ktlint:standard:other-rule-id")
    import foo.*

    // Suppress all rules for the annotated construct
    @Suppress("ktlint")
    import foo.*
    ```
=== "[:material-heart:](#) EOL comments"

    ```kotlin
    // Suppress a single rule for the commented line
    import foo.* // ktlint-disable standard_no-wildcard-imports

    // Suppress multiple rules for the commented line
    import foo.* // ktlint-disable standard_no-wildcard-imports standard_other-rule-id

    // Suppress all rules for the commented line
    import foo.* // ktlint-disable
    ```

=== "[:material-heart-off-outline:](#) Block comments"

    ```kotlin
    // Suppress a single rule for all code between the start and end tag
    /* ktlint-disable standard_no-wildcard-imports */
    import foo.*
    /* ktlint-disable standard_no-wildcard-imports */

    // Suppress multiple rules for all code between the start and end tag
    /* ktlint-disable standard_no-wildcard-imports standard_no-wildcard-imports */
    import foo.*
    /* ktlint-enable standard_no-wildcard-imports standard_no-wildcard-imports */

    // Suppress all rules for all code between the start and end tag
    /* ktlint-disable */
    import foo.*
    /* ktlint-enable */
    ```

!!! important
    When using the block comments, the `ktlint-enable` directive needs to specify the exact same rule-id's and in the same order as the `ktlint-disable` directive.

!!! warning
    From a consistency perspective seen, it might be best to **not** mix the (EOL/Block) comment style with the annotation style in the same project.

## How do I globally disable a rule without `.editorconfig`?

When using Ktlint CLI, you may pass a list of disabled rules via the `--disabled_rules` command line flag. The value is a comma separated list of rule id's that have to be disabled. The rule id must be fully qualified (e.g. must be prefixed with the rule set id). 


## Why is `.editorconfig` property `disabled_rules` deprecated and how do I resolve this?

The `.editorconfig` properties `disabled_rules` and `ktlint_disabled_rules` are deprecated as of KtLint version `0.48` and are removed in version `0.49`. Those properties contain a comma separated list of rules which are disabled. Using a comma separated list of values has some disadvantages.

A big disadvantage is that it is not possible to override the property partially in an `.editorconfig` file in a subpackage. Another disadvantage is that it is not possible to express explicitly that a rule is enabled. Lastly, (qualified) rule ids can be 20 characters or longer, which makes a list with multiple entries hard to read.

Starting with KtLint `0.48` entire rule sets and individual rules can be disabled / enabled with a separate property per rule (set). Examples:
```editorconfig
ktlint_standard = disabled # Disable all rules from the `standard` rule set provided by KtLint
ktlint_standard_final-newline = enabled # Enables the `final-newline` rule in the `standard` rule set provided by KtLint
ktlint_experimental = enabled # Enable rules marked as experimental for all rule sets that are enabled
ktlint_standard_some-experimental-rule = disabled # Disables the (experimental) `some-experimental-rule` in the `standard` rule set provided by KtLint
ktlint_custom-rule-set = enabled # Enable all rules in the `custom-rule-set` rule set (not provided by KtLint)
ktlint_custom-rule-set_custom-rule = disabled # Disables the `custom-rule` rule in the `custom-rule-set` rule set (not provided by KtLint)
```

!!! note
    All rules from the `standard` and custom rule sets are *enabled* by default and can optionally be disabled in the `.editorconfig`. All `experimental` rules are *disabled* by default and can optionally be enabled in the `.editorconfig`.

!!! note
    The *rule* properties are applied after applying the *rule set* properties and take precedence. So if a rule set is disabled but a specific rule of that rule set is enabled, then the rule will be executed.  

## Why is wildcard import `java.util.*` not reported by the `no-wildcard-imports` rule?

The `no-wildcard-imports` rule forbids wildcard imports, except for imports defined in `.editorconfig` property `ij_kotlin_packages_to_use_import_on_demand`. If this property is not explicitly set, it allows wildcards imports like `java.util.*` by default to keep in sync with IntelliJ IDEA behavior.

## Can I use KtLint to directly format the code I'm generating with KotlinPoet?

Yes, it is possible to use KtLint to directly format the code generated with KotlinPoet. 
To do so, you must include the dependencies `com.pinterest.ktlint:ktlint-core` and `com.pinterest.ktlint:ktlint-ruleset-standard` in your Gradle/Maven project.

!!! warning
    Do not include the dependency `com.pinterest:ktlint` as that would import the entire ktlint project including unwanted dependencies. Besides a much bigger artifact, it might also result in problems regarding logging.

To format the output of KotlinPoet with KtLint, you can use the following snippet:

```kotlin
val ruleProviders = buildSet {
  ServiceLoader
      .load(RuleSetProviderV2::class.java)
      .flatMapTo(this) { it.getRuleProviders() }
}
val ktLintRuleEngine = KtLintRuleEngine(
  ruleProviders = ruleProviders,
  editorConfigDefaults = EditorConfigDefaults.load(EDITORCONFIG_PATH),
)
ktLintRuleEngine.format(outputDir.toPath())
```
Here, outputDir refers to the directory of the generated files by KotlinPoet, ktLintRuleEngine is an instance of KtLint rule engine.

It is also possible to format file-by-file the output of KotlinPoet if you write your `FileSpec` to a `StringBuilder()`, instead of a `File`, 
and send the generated code as `String` to KtLint inside a `CodeSnippet`:
```kotlin
kotlinFile.writeText(
  ktLintRuleEngine.format(
    Code.CodeSnippet(
      stringBuilder.toString()
    )
  )
)
```

# Are formatter tags respected?

As of version `0.49.x` the formatter tags of IntelliJ IDEA are respected. By default, those formatter tags are disabled. The formatter tags can be enabled with `.editorconfig` properties below:
```editorconfig
ij_formatter_tags_enabled = true # Defaults to 'false'
ij_formatter_off_tag = some-custom-off-tag # Defaults to '@formatter:off'
ij_formatter_on_tag = some-custom-on-tag # Defaults to '@formatter:on'
```

When enabled, the ktlint rule checking is disabled for all code surrounded by the formatter tags.
