# Code of Conduct

At Pinterest, we work hard to ensure that our work environment is welcoming
and inclusive to as many people as possible. We are committed to creating this
environment for everyone involved in our open source projects as well. We
welcome all participants regardless of ability, age, ethnicity, identified
gender, religion (or lack there of), sexual orientation and socioeconomic
status.

This code of conduct details our expectations for upholding these values.

## Good behavior

We expect members of our community to exhibit good behavior including (but of
course not limited to):

- Using intentional and empathetic language.
- Focusing on resolving instead of escalating conflict.
- Providing constructive feedback.

## Unacceptable behavior

Some examples of unacceptable behavior (again, this is not an exhaustive
list):

- Harassment, publicly or in private.
- Trolling.
- Sexual advances (this isn’t the place for it).
- Publishing other’s personal information.
- Any behavior which would be deemed unacceptable in a professional environment.

## Recourse

If you are witness to or the target of unacceptable behavior, it should be
reported to Pinterest at opensource-policy@pinterest.com. All reporters will
be kept confidential and an appropriate response for each incident will be
evaluated.

If the maintainers do not uphold and enforce this code of conduct in
good faith, community leadership will hold them accountable.
