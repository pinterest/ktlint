Note that following is configured on purpose:
* Files `test-baseline.xml` and `config/test-baseline.xml` are identical.
* The references to the rules do not include the rule set id `standard:`.
* All test files contain an empty function body which is registered in the baseline file.
* The `TextBaselineExtraErrorFile` contains an additional error (a single line block comment).
