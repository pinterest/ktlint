# Custom integration

!!! warning
    This page is based on Ktlint `0.49.x` which has to be released. Most concepts are also applicable for `0.48.x`.  

## Ktlint Rule Engine

The `Ktlint Rule Engine` is the central entry point for custom integrations with the `Ktlint API`. See [basic API Consumer](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/blob/master/ktlint-api-consumer/src/main/kotlin/com/example/ktlint/api/consumer/KtlintApiConsumer.kt) for a basic example on how to invoke the `Ktlint Rule Engine`. This example also explains how the logging of the `Ktlint Rule Engine` can be configured to your needs.

The `KtLintRuleEngine` instance only needs to be created once for the entire lifetime of your application. Reusing the same instance results in better performance due to caching. 

```kotlin title="Creating the KtLintRuleEngine"
val ktLintRuleEngine =
    KtLintRuleEngine(
        ruleProviders = KTLINT_API_CONSUMER_RULE_PROVIDERS,
    )
```

### Rule provider

The `KtLintRuleEngine` must be configured with at least one `RuleProvider`. A `RuleProvider` is a lambda which upon request of the `KtLintRuleEngine` provides a new instance of a specific rule. You can either provide any of the standard rules provided by KtLint or with your own custom rules, or with a combination of both.
```kotlin title="Creating a set of RuleProviders"
val KTLINT_API_CONSUMER_RULE_PROVIDERS =
    setOf(
        // Can provide custom rules
        RuleProvider { NoVarRule() },
        // but also reuse rules from KtLint rulesets
        RuleProvider { IndentationRule() },
    )
```

### Editor config: defaults & overrides

When linting and formatting files, the `KtlintRuleEngine` takes the `.editorconfig` file(s) into account which are found on the path to the file. A property which is specified in the `editorConfigOverride` property of the `KtLintRuleEngine` takes precedence above the value of that same property in the `.editorconfig` file. The `editorConfigDefaults` property of the `KtLintRuleEngine` can be used to specify the fallback values for properties in case that property is not defined in the `.editorconfig` file (or in the `editorConfigOverride` property).

```kotlin title="Specifying the editorConfigOverride"
val ktLintRuleEngine =
    KtLintRuleEngine(
        ruleProviders = KTLINT_API_CONSUMER_RULE_PROVIDERS,
        editorConfigOverride = EditorConfigOverride.from(
          INDENT_STYLE_PROPERTY to IndentConfig.IndentStyle.SPACE,
          INDENT_SIZE_PROPERTY to 4
        )
    )
```

The `editorConfigOverride` property takes an `EditorConfigProperty` as key. KtLint defines several such properties, but they can also be defined as part of a custom rule.

The `editorConfigDefaults` property is more cumbersome to define as it is based directly on the data format of the `ec4j` library which is used for parsing the `.editorconfig` file.

The defaults can be loaded from a path or a directory. If a path to a file is specified, the name of the file does not necessarily have to end with `.editorconfig`. If a path to a directory is specified, the directory should contain a file with name `.editorconfig`. Note that the `propertyTypes` have to be derived from the same collection of rule providers that are specified in the `ruleProviders` property of the `KtLintRuleEngine`.  

```kotlin title="Specifying the editorConfigDefaults using an '.editorconfig' file"
val ktLintRuleEngine =
    KtLintRuleEngine(
        ruleProviders = KTLINT_API_CONSUMER_RULE_PROVIDERS,
        editorConfigDefaults = EditorConfigDefaults.load(
            path = Paths.get("/some/path/to/editorconfig/file/or/directory"),
            propertyTypes = KTLINT_API_CONSUMER_RULE_PROVIDERS.propertyTypes(),
        )
  )
```
If you want to include all RuleProviders of the Ktlint project than you can easily retrieve the collection using `StandardRuleSetProvider().getRuleProviders()`.

The `EditorConfigDefaults` property can also be specified programmatically as is shown below:

```kotlin title="Specifying the editorConfigDefaults programmatically"
val ktLintRuleEngine =
    KtLintRuleEngine(
        ruleProviders = KTLINT_API_CONSUMER_RULE_PROVIDERS,
        editorConfigDefaults = EditorConfigDefaults(
            org.ec4j.core.model.EditorConfig
                .builder()
                // .. add relevant properties
                .build()
        )
    )
```

### Lint & format

Once the `KtLintRuleEngine` has been defined, it is ready to be invoked for each file or code snippet that has to be linted or formatted. The the `lint` and `format` functions take a `Code` instance as parameter. Such an instance can either be created from a file
```kotlin title="Code from file"
val code = Code.fromFile(
    File("/some/path/to/file")
)
```
or a code snippet (set `script` to `true` to handle the snippet as Kotlin script):
```kotlin title="Code from snippet"
val code = Code.fromSnippet(
    """
    val code = "some-code"
    """.trimIndent()
)
```

The `lint` function is invoked with a lambda which is called each time a `LintError` is found and does not return a result.
```kotlin title="Specifying the editorConfigDefaults programmatically"
ktLintRuleEngine
  .lint(codeFile) { lintError ->
    // handle
  }
```

The `format` function is invoked with a lambda which is called each time a `LintError` is found and returns the formatted code as result. Note that the `LintError` should be inspected for errors that could not be autocorrected.
```kotlin title="Specifying the editorConfigDefaults programmatically"
val formattedCode =
    ktLintRuleEngine
        .format(codeFile) { lintError ->
          // handle
        }
```

## Logging

Ktlint uses the `io.github.microutils:kotlin-logging` which is a `slf4j` wrapper. As API consumer you can choose which logging framework you want to use and configure that framework to your exact needs. The [basic API Consumer](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/blob/master/ktlint-api-consumer/src/main/kotlin/com/example/ktlint/api/consumer/KtlintApiConsumer.kt) contains an example with `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple` as logging provider and a customized configuration which shows logging at `DEBUG` level for all classes except one specific class which only displays logging at `WARN` level.
