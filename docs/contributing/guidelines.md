## Making Changes

!!! tip
    `ktlint` only provides rules that enforce the [Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) or [Android Kotlin style guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide). If your change is more opinionated than please [file an issue](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/issues/new) first so that it can be discussed amongst the community. Rules which are too opinionated might be better published as a custom rule set. 

1. Fork this repository to your own account
2. Make your changes and verify that tests pass
3. Commit your work and push to a new branch on your fork
4. Submit a pull request
5. Participate in the code review process by responding to feedback

Once there is agreement that the code is in good shape, one of the project's maintainers will merge your contribution.

To increase the chances that your pull request will be accepted:

- Follow the coding style
- Write tests for your changes
- Write a good commit message
- Provide context in the pull request description.

New rules will be added first to the `experimental` rule set before being promoted to the `standard` rule set.
