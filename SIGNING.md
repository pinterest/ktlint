Release artifacts are signed. This is handled by the GitHub workflow. 

To test the creation of signed artifacts on the local machine, follow steps below:

* Change property `VERSION_NAME` in `gradle.properties` so that it does not end with `-SNAPSHOT`. Whenever the version ends with `-SNAPSHOT`, the artifacts are never signed. Make sure that this change is not committed.
* Use [GPG](https://infra.apache.org/openpgp.html#key-gen-generate-key) to generate a key. Maven requires a RSA key of at least 4096 bits. Most likely it does not matter for local publication whether this is used. Execute command:
  ```
  gpg --full-gen-key
  ```
  * Please select what kind of key you want: 1) RSA - RSA
  * What keysize do you want? 4096
  * Key is valid for? 0 (does not expire)
  * Real-name: ktlint-test 
  * Email address: ktlint-test@nowhere.com
  * Comment: Test signing of ktlint artifacts on local machine only
  * Passphrase: i-will-try-no-to-forget-this-passphrase
  * The output ends with something like
  ```text
  pub   rsa4096 2023-10-08 [SC]
        5B0ABB03277D2FEB46FE7E8E22D6006063A5D3C3
  uid                      ktlint-test (Test signing of ktlint artifacts on local machine only) <ktlint-test@nowhere.com>
  sub   rsa4096 2023-10-08 [E]
  ```
* Execute all commands below in the same terminal
  ```shell
  export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKeyId="63A5D3C3" # Last 8 characters of full id of the public key generated by gpg command above
  export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKeyPassword="i-will-try-no-to-forget-this-passphrase"
  # Command below will export the armored GPG signing key and store it in an environment variable. Note that this command will ask for the password (see ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingKeyPassword).
  export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKey="$(gpg --export-secret-keys --armor $ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_signingInMemoryKeyId | tail -r | tail -n +3 | tail -r | tail -n +3 | tr -d '\n')"
  ```
* Execute the Gradle publication (this can not be combined with the export statements above because of the manual input of the passphrase)
  ```
  ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
  ```
